The first development of Karsten typeface was inspired by signs on some old Dutch-buildings in Java. Then in the making, it blends with modern style. It's a synthesis between two cultures, the East & the West. The typeface was named after the Dutch architect who gave major contributions to architecture and town planning in Indonesia, Herman Thomas Karsten.
